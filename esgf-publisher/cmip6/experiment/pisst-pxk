    "description": "Same as piSST, but with a spatially and temporally uniform SST anomaly applied on top of the monthly-varying piSST SSTs. The magnitude of the uniform increase is taken from each model's global, climatological annual mean SST change between abrupt4xCO2 minus piControl (using the mean of years 111-140 of abrupt4xCO2, and the parallel 30-year section of piControl)",
